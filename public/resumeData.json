    "bio": "Hi there! I am Robert Graczyk, Full-Stack Web Developer certified in the MERN stack. I have a passion for Frontend Development, but am capable of working on the Backend as well. When COVID-19 hit, I lost my previous job which forced me to consider a different Career path. Coding has always been something that has interested me, so I decided to take the leap and enroll in a Full-Stack Web Development program through Devmountain. I hope that my most Recent Works speak for themselves in regards to what I am capable of in this field. When you spend 12-14 hours a day for a few months on any given topic, that topic begins to become very clear. I have learned more in those 13 weeks than both my Highschool and College experiences combined. My problem solving skills and willingness to work together as a team would make me a good candidate for any company in need of a Junior Web Developer!",
